Problem Statement - 
	Tech Service companies want to sent cold emails to clients.
	Clients Job Portal -> Based on JD - > Tech Service sends cold email to client for outsource work.
	The Email should be relevant to the job post.

Tech Architecture - 
	1. Extract text from career page using Lang Chain Framework.
	2. LLM (llama 3.1) extract JD info (roles, skills) into a json format.
	3. From chroma DB we fetch portfolio links based on jd.
	4. WE feed the portfolio link  + Json to LLM
	5. LLM will finally create a nice cold email processing this input.
LLAMA - 
	Free Open Source LLM
	We can download and run this LLM locally.
	We can use tools such as OLLAMA to pull and run the LLAMA models.
	We can Use GroqCloud for running LLAMA on cloud
		Inference is very fast.
		It uses LPU (Language Processing Unit) so its very fast.
